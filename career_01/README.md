Topic:   GORM Data Services
Hosted by Bruce Alspaugh
Preliminary Research:   I read the exellent write up about GORM and the presenter on the meet-up app. I then googled ORM and Groovy  to help me understand the meet-up  over view.  I also made sure to look up the location.
Questions for Meetup:   What is the interaction betwee GORM, Groovy, Grails, Hibernte, and SpringBoot?  How does it work in Java?
Next Steps:   GORM is part of the Grails web framework.  GORM Data Services allow your program to access a database through interfaces with no classes, and different types of databases can be accessed through the same code which is used to create database interaction bytecode at compile time. It looks really useful and flexible and the presenter was good at explaining and giving code examples.
To learn more I could read, The Definitive Guid to Grails, I could look for oci training resources on this topic.  I could also try some of the on-line tutorials to learn Grails and GORM. One example is: GRAILS COOKBOOK - Beginners Tutorial - Introduction to GORM.
