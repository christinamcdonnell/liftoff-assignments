# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview   1-2 para, elevator pitch, non tech
DanceBreaks is my new web app for users to search for and store links to all their favorite dance pix, songs, and videos. The focus is geared toward West Coast Swing Dance (at least in the beginning) and probably the most useful feature will be the Dance Partner Matching tool to help dancers find a partner for different competitions or even for practice partners. The match will take into consideration the dancers role (lead/follow) and current competition level. Personally, I can't wait to use that feature! & I have other people asking when it will be available for them.

After those features get off the ground, I'll be culling dance news from various web sources and posting the info link on the homepage and maybe more personalized interests to each users personal page. Other cool features will be calendars of dance events and a "bulletin board" for ride & room share requests.  Can't wait to get this going!
